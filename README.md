# CS330-OpenGL

1. How do I approach designing software?

  I approach dessigning software by generally going into what exists and "trial and error"-ing it to figure out how it works. This project really helped me work on using multiple files from different filepaths within a project, creating objects and modifying them, and most importantly, an understanding of how to use OpenGL, something I've never done before. My design process was to continuously work on the project a little at a time. I made sure to complete each assignment for each week of the class in which we generally added a new aspect of the project. We started with one complex object made of multiple polygonal shpaes. Then we added textures the following week. I made sure to add a couple other objects to my scene as well as textures for those objects once I understood how to apply the textures. After that we added camera movement and I continued building more objects in my scene. Then we added lighting, and I started working on the more complex objects in the scene. Finally, we put the whole project together and I finished adding the last components of the more complex objects as well as adjust other lighting and texture settings. This process can help me in my future work because working on the assignment a little at a time and applying new features as I implemented them can make the process more manageable. By creating one object to start and learning to apply textures to that object made creating and applying textures to other objects much easier.


  
2. How do I approach developing programs?

    Again, OpenGL was not something I have ever worked with or anything similar, so learning how to develop programs in OpenGL was all new to me. It helped me work with incorporating libraries and directories in order to make an API function well. By repetitively doing similar tasks thorughout the creation of the project, I was able to get a better grasp on the different concepts we worked on. For example, I struggled to implement lighting at first. Once I understood it and added lighting to a specific object, I was able to add it to other objects more easily as I had a better understanding of how the process worked. I think I'm still learning better ways to develop code efficiently, but something that I am reminded of is to really check on how things are written in the code. One of my issues developing the lighting was that I included code from another cpp file and didn't update the functions in my project, so the lighting shaders were not being used at all.



3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

    Computer science will help me reach my goals because I want to be a software engineer. I hope to either work for a development firm or possibly work on coding within the video game industry. Understanding graphics and visualization will help me in my education and in my professional careers as I can use these skills in creating visuals for future projects or possibly for future programs when I enter the field.
